### 🧠 Bridging Microelectronics & Neuroscience
I am a **PhD Innovation Fellow** at **Dartmouth College (Thayer School of Engineering)**. My work sits at the intersection of microelectronics and neuroscience, with a mission to build the next generation of high-bandwidth neural interfaces.

I specialize in the **end-to-end development** of miniaturized hardware—from the cleanroom (microfabrication) to the bench (PCB & assembly) and finally to *in vivo* validation.
