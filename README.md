## 🚀 Welcome
This repository hosts the source code for my personal academic portfolio. I am a Ph.D. Candidate at Dartmouth's Thayer School of Engineering (expected 2026), focusing on architecting advanced electrical systems for medical devices.

- **Personal Homepage**: [https://tianyu-bai.github.io](https://tianyu-bai.github.io)
- **Key Research**: High-density PCB design (Altium), low-noise analog sensor interfaces, and mixed-signal system integration.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Automatic Google Scholar Updates**: Daily synchronization of citation counts using GitHub Actions (Scholar ID: pX1H0FgAAAAJ).
- **Project Showcase**: Dedicated sections for the **PEDAL-256** project, including 40% increased signal throughput and PCBA reliability testing.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Jekyll, ensuring a seamless experience across all viewports.
- **SEO Ready**: Optimized for research visibility in the biomedical engineering community.

## 🛠️ Quick Setup for Maintenance

1. **Google Scholar Sync**:
    - Ensure `GOOGLE_SCHOLAR_ID` is set to `pX1H0FgAAAAJ` in `Settings -> Secrets -> Actions`.
2. **Global Settings**:
    - Modify `_config.yml` for title, description, and social media links.
    - Confirm `repository` is set to `Tianyu-Bai/tianyu-bai.github.io`.
3. **Content Editing**:
    - **Home/Bio**: Edit `_pages/about.md`.
    - **Portfolio**: Add project markdowns to `_portfolio/`.
    - **Publications**: Manage academic papers in `_publications/`.
